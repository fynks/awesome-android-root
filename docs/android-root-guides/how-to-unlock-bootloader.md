# Bootloader Unlocking Guide

Essential guide to unlocking Android bootloaders - the first step for rooting, custom ROMs, and advanced Android customization.

- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
- [Wall of Shame](#bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame)

## What is a Bootloader?

A **bootloader** is a small program that runs when your Android device powers on. Think of it as the gatekeeper that:

- **Starts the operating system** - Loads Android when you turn on your device
- **Verifies system integrity** - Checks that the software hasn't been tampered with
- **Controls what can run** - Determines which operating systems and recovery modes are allowed
- **Manages security** - Enforces manufacturer restrictions and security policies

### Locked vs Unlocked Bootloaders

| **Locked Bootloader** | **Unlocked Bootloader** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| ✅ Maximum security | ✅ Full customization freedom |
| ✅ Official updates work seamlessly | ✅ Can install custom ROMs |
| ✅ Banking apps work without issues | ✅ Can install custom recovery |
| ❌ No custom modifications allowed | ✅ Advanced root access possible |
| ❌ Cannot install custom recovery | ❌ Voids manufacturer warranty |
| ❌ Limited customization options | ❌ Potential security risks |

## Before You Begin

::: danger ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS
- **🗑️ DATA LOSS**: Unlocking bootloader **WILL ERASE ALL DATA** on your device
- **🔒 WARRANTY VOID**: Most manufacturers void warranty when bootloader is unlocked
- **🏦 BANKING APPS**: Some banking and financial apps may stop working
- **🔐 SECURITY RISK**: Unlocked bootloaders reduce device security
- **📱 BRICK RISK**: Improper procedures can render your device unusable
:::

### What You Need
**Device Requirements:**
- ✅ Supported device (check [Wall of Shame](#bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame) first)
- ✅ 50%+ battery charge
- ✅ Complete data backup

**Software & Tools:**
- **ADB/Fastboot**: [Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) or [Minimal ADB](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=746010030569952951)
- **USB Drivers**: Manufacturer-specific (Windows)
- **Manufacturer Tools**: Mi Unlock Tool (Xiaomi), Odin (Samsung), etc.

**Knowledge & Time:**

::: tip 📋 Important: Boot to Recovery First
After installing custom recovery, **boot directly to recovery mode** before normal boot to prevent stock recovery restoration.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OEM Unlocking" Missing/Grayed Out**

- Try different network (mobile vs WiFi)
- Some carriers permanently block this option

**Fastboot Not Recognized**
- Install proper USB drivers (Windows)
- Try different USB ports/cables
- Disable antivirus temporarily
- Use different computer if available

**"Remote: Not Allowed" Error**
- Verify device supports unlocking (check Wall of Shame)
- Ensure OEM Unlocking is enabled
- Some carrier variants block unlocking

**Device Won't Boot After Unlock**
1. Don't panic - often normal after unlock
2. Hold power button 10+ seconds to force restart
3. Try booting to recovery mode
4. Boot to fastboot and re-flash stock firmware if needed

### Emergency Recovery
**Soft Brick Recovery**:
1. Boot to fastboot mode (hardware keys)
2. Flash stock boot: `fastboot flash boot boot.img`
3. Restart: `fastboot reboot`

**Prevention**: Always have stock firmware downloaded and know your device's emergency download mode.

## Bootloader Unlock: Wall of Shame

This community-maintained [repository](https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame) tracks companies that make bootloader unlocking difficult or impossible:

### 🚫 Most Restrictive (Avoid for Unlocking)
- **Samsung US (Snapdragon)** - Permanently locked, no official method
- **Huawei/Honor (2018+)** - Discontinued official unlocking  
- **Verizon Devices** - Most models have locked bootloaders
- **AT&T Devices** - Many models restrict unlocking

### ⚠️ Partially Restrictive
- **Xiaomi** - Requires waiting period (7-30 days) and approval
- **Oppo/OnePlus (newer)** - Increasingly restrictive policies
- **Realme** - Limited official support
- **Carrier Variants** - Often more restrictive than unlocked models

### ✅ Developer-Friendly (Recommended)
- **Google Pixel** - Easy official unlocking, excellent custom ROM support
- **Sony** - Official developer support, good documentation
- **Motorola** - Official unlock portal, generally supportive
- **OnePlus (older models)** - Traditionally developer-friendly
- **Essential Phone** - Developer-focused (discontinued)

### 🔄 Policy Changes
Manufacturer policies change frequently. Always check current status before purchasing if bootloader unlocking is important to you.

::: tip 💡 Before Buying
Check the Wall of Shame repository and recent community discussions before purchasing. Newer models may have different restrictions than older ones from the same manufacturer.
